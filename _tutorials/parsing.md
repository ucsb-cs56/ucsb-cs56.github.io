This series of articles is here to support programming assignments based on *parsing*. The series presents some of the basic concepts that are used in parsers and interpreters.   

It is not intended as a full treatment of those topics, but rather as "just enough" material to help you complete a programming assignment that involves parsing of arithmetic expressions.     We do not expect you to be familiar with these topics already, so we are providing a brief overview in this tutorial.

For the "rest of the story", you'll need to wait for later courses such as:

* [CMPSC 138](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/cmpsc-138) (Automata and Formal Languages)
* [CMPSC 160](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/cmpsc-160) (Compilers)
* [CMPSC 162](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/education/courses/cmpsc-162) (Programming Languages)
