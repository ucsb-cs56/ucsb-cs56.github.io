Timeboxed meeting (5-15 minutes), where everyone stands (to keep the meeting short)

* What tasks did you work on **yesterday** (or *since last standup*
* What tasks will you commit to **today** (or *between now and next standup*) 
* Do you have any impediments/barriers/dependencies (anything that's preventing you from progressing)

Each team should decide its own norms. You should decide on your own norms, but these are some norms that many teams find useful to commit to.

* One person talks at a time
* Be on time
* Keep it high level; avoid detail
   * Defer detailed conversations to later
* Avoid electronics (unless needed for reference)
* Avoid side conversations
