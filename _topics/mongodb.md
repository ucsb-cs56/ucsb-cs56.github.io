* [MongoDB Javadoc](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.6/javadoc/)

MongoDB is a particular implementation of a technology known as NoSQL databases.

The basic idea is that you can store JSON objects in the cloud.   
Everything else is just sort of a riff on that theme.

Here is a repo that demos MLab in the context of a Spring Boot application:
* <https://github.com/pconrad-webapps/simple-java-mlab-demo>

There is already a lot of info about MongoDB at this other website: <http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb/>
* In particular, this page about Java stuff: <http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb_java/>
* It also discusses how to get started with [MLab](http://pconrad-webapps.github.io/topics/mongodb_mlab/) which is a particular provider of MongoDB (e.g. Mlab is to MongoDB like github is to git)
