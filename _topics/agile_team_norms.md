When an Agile team forms, it is customary to set **team norms** early in the team forming process.

This 10 minute video 
illustrates setting team norms: [Agile Simulation - Part 3 | Purpose, Agenda, Team Norms](https://youtu.be/DcpyeafBkfQ)

The norms illustrated in the video, while common, are just examples.   

* The team norms should be chosen by the team itself, 
* Being a part of the team represents a committment to those norms.   
* Therefore, the norms should be ones that the team can come to consensus on.    
* Different teams will have slightly different team norms, based on the context, personality of the team members, level of experience, etc.
