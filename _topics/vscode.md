# How to get it

* On CSIL, type `code` to access the VS Code editor.
* For your own machine, download it from here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

# Customizing it

You'll likely need to add some "extensions" for the programming languages that you want to use (Java, C++, etc.)

# Tips and Tricks

* Multiline Editing: (copied [from here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30039968))
   * On Windows, you hold Ctrl+Alt while pressing the up ↑ or down ↓ arrow keys to add cursors. 
   * On Mac, ⌥ Opt+⌘ Cmd+↑/↓
   * On Linux, Shift+Alt+↑/↓
   
   
# Settings for Java Formatting

If you want to use the "fluent" format for code such as:

```java
@Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/", "/greeting", "/login**", "/webjars/**", "/error**", "/searchResults**", "/search/**")
        .permitAll()
        .anyRequest()
        .authenticated()
        .and()
        .oauth2Login()
        .loginPage("/login")
        .and()
        .logout()
        .deleteCookies("remove")
        .invalidateHttpSession(true)
        .logoutUrl("/logout")
        .logoutSuccessUrl("/")
        .permitAll();
  }
```

# Mac OS Specific

On MacOS, if you want to be able to type `code .` at the Terminal command line
to open vscode in the current directory, here's what you need to do:
* Open the Command Palette (⇧⌘P) and type `shell command` to find the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command` option
* Select that option, and behind the scenes, it will do the needed stuff to update your path.
* You will need to open a new Terminal window to see that take effect.
