The big picture
---------------

As page 27 explains, this chapter helps us get out of main and really embrace the whole Object Oriented stuff that Java is supposed to be about. If your previous exposure to Java was all about writing programs where there was only one class, most of your code was in the main, and if you did make other methods, they were all `static`, then this Chapter is the antidote.

Chapter 2, page-by-page
-----------------------

### page 27

Page 27 is about "the big picture" of this chapter--see comments above.

### page 28

Page 28 starts a little story about Larry and Brad, and an Aeron
chair. In case you don't know, Aeron chairs are supposed to be really
comfortable, but they are also really expensive.

(Back in the days of Silicon Valley excess (dot-com bubble days), they
were all the rage at companies with too much money and not enough
sense--see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeron_chair>)

This is sort of the hallmark of the Head First books—telling a story
to try to pull you in, and teaching something about Java on the
way. The code they are writing is sort of silly, but the concepts are
important, so suspend your disbelief and go with it.

### page 29

"The spec always changes". This is a big part of what good software
design is about—making sure you design things in a way that you are
prepared for change. Its one of the reasons I want you to write lots
of code (for the choice points exercises) that become the basis for
building something bigger later—so that you can see how, as you build
on previous code, that code something has to change to accommodate new
needs.

As you can see, the point here is that some designs accomodate change
more easily than others.

### page 30-32

On pages to 32, the discussion continues and we start to get into inheritance.

### pages 33-34

Pages 33 and 34 invite you to really think about Object Oriented
design--the choices that you make when you choose the methods and
attributes of a class. We'll be doing a lot of that in this course, so
I want to really invite you to spend some time on these two pages
thinking about the content.

Having said that, I think the Television exercise on p. 34 is sort of
dumb. I'd rather ask you to create an object for a CalendarEvent, or a
UCSBCourse, or a UCSBStudent, and think about what the methods and
attributes would be--something you might actually use in a Java
program.
